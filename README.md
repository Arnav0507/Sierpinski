# 🧩 Chaos Game Fractals: Sierpinski Triangle & Hexagon

This Java Swing project visualizes fractals using the **Chaos Game** algorithm. It includes implementations of both the classic **Sierpinski Triangle** and a **Sierpinski Hexagon**. Users can interactively generate points to explore the formation of these fractals in real time.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Sierpinski Triangle**: Generated by repeatedly moving halfway toward one of three fixed triangle vertices.
- ✅ **Sierpinski Hexagon**: Generated using six vertices spaced evenly in a hexagon, creating a star-like fractal pattern.
- 🎨 Interactive visualization using **Java Swing**.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard controls** to adjust the number of points rendered at runtime.
- 🌌 Smooth rendering of thousands of points.

## 🧠 How It Works

This project implements the **Chaos Game**, a randomized algorithm that generates fractal structures by:

1. Defining a set of **fixed corner points** (triangle or hexagon).
2. Choosing an initial **random point** inside the polygon.
3. Repeating the following process:
   - Randomly choose one of the corner points.
   - Move a fraction (e.g., 1/2 for triangle, 1/3 for hexagon) of the distance toward the chosen point.
   - Plot the new point.

Over time, a fractal emerges due to the deterministic constraints of the midpoint rule and corner selection.
